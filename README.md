# Face-Detector
## Install & configure
To install the program you can use the command `git clone https://github.com/Fedi6431/Face-Detector.git` or you can simply download the zip file and extract it.


After downloading the program go to the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/) site and download version 4.10.0 with [the installer](https://github.com/opencv/opencv /releases/download/4.10.0/opencv-4.10.0-windows.exe) for windows. 

After downloading and starting the installer you need to select the folder where the extraction will take place, in this case, the folder of our program ( Ex. C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\Face-detector ) and press extract.

After the program has extracted all the files, you can run `iml_debug_configuration.bat` which will ask for the system structure (x64 or x32) and configure the iml file for debugging.
